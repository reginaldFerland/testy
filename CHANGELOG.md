# Changelog

## 1.0.0

- Own Test Explorer integration backed by .NET 10+ and Microsoft.Testing.Platform; no Dev Kit dependency.
- Automatic startup baseline and affected test-file execution based on recorded runtime code usage.
- Roslyn declaration analysis triggers project fallback for compile-time dependencies such as inlined constants.
- Retained coverage contributions, stale coverage markers, and conservative fallback for uncertain impact.
- Live test results, source locations, failure details, and a compact status display.
- Default editor-save triggers, optional file-system watching, generated-file exclusions, and pause/resume.
- Cancellation scoped to Testy-owned automatic runs, with pending changes preserved across restarts.
- Refresh builds, rediscovers, and runs all tests. Coverage, full-suite mode, and runner settings are configurable.

## 0.0.1

- Initial file-watcher prototype using C# Dev Kit and global VS Code test commands.
